5,"Book: The book I read was Cinder
Author: The author is Marissa Meyer
Hook: There a lot of things that cinder does not know about her past, but there is one thing that separates her from everyone else.
Introduction: This book was quite exciting. It is about a cyborg named Cinder who lives with her adopted family. Andre the mother does not like cinder at all. Peoni and Pearl are her two sisters. Cinder does not seem to get along with pearl, but she gets along with Peoni
Theme: It is mainly about why cyborgs don't fit in, and how it would feel to be different from everybody else
Qoutes: The Doctor: His eyebrows rose, his blue eyes sucking in all the light of the room. ""The cybernetic operation? "" Iko the android: We all have weaknesses mine is shoes.

The book also taught me that friends are everything. The amount of perils that Harry, Ron, and Hermione go through together in this book is unforgettable, and it always stuck with me that Ron took one for the team in the end of the book knowing that he could have very well been hurt. Finally, this book taught me that love always wins. When it became clear that Lord Voldemort was going to defeat Harry when they were in the basement, I was thinking to myself, ""How could this happen?""

This allow people who are in possession of the eldunari to possess an efficient  way of communication with that dragon.

In addition magicians can use this energy taken from the eldunari to perform amazing feats of magic that require an extremely large amount of energy that the magician itself can never be capable of producing. There are also special jewels that can store energy for later use by the magician. In my book, the dragons have gone extinct because of an unknown cause; in their last moments, the dragons managed to transfer their eldunari out of their body and send it off to a secret hiding spot. A few hundred years later, a girl finds one such stash of eldunari. The dragons inside the eldunari teach her about her magic and how to control it.

Later they found out Stef went surfing by herself at night. They needed to rescue her so they took a neighbor's old boat out of his garage.

They looked around and they did not know which way was land. After several days on the water they get back. Not all of them come back alive.

1384,"I think that the author had a very untraditional writing style, with many different stories in the same story inside the book.
I would recommend the book to my friends because it was very interesting and engaging and it had a very good hook. Because of the magic and evil parts, you start to really want to see what will happen next.
The book is called ""On the Day I Died - Stories from the Grave"", by Candace Fleming.
One unusual day, teen Mike Kowalski is driving home from a party. Then, he finds a very queer looking girl on the side of the road, and decides to give her a ride home. Shortly, he finds she forgot her shoes in the car. He turns back to drop them off at her house, and much to his surprise, he finds that she has been dead for fifty years! He just gave a ghost a ride home... What is happening here?
Summary
Exposition - We learned about who mike is and how he gets to the graveyard. 
Rising Action/ Climax/Falling Action - all of the stories have their own Freytag's pyramid, so I'm not sure what to do on this one. Everyone told their stories, and in between we did go back to the present with how mike was talking to all of them.
Resolution - We learned that Mike almost died, and why he got to hear all their stories. 
Theme - Mainly sad, and magical, because that was the theme of all of the different stories. Sad because, well, they were all dead/ almost dead. 
Recommendation - I would recommend this book to my friends! It was very very good. It had great characters you will start to deeply care about, and I loved how the story was formatted differently. If you do not like sad endings, or magic, this book is probably not for you, though. For example, Gina's story. You do care about her very much, and you have started to despise Anthony. Then, when Gina dies in the fire, you feel so sad, but you are happy that you read it. 
Specific parts - again, if you do not like sad ending or magical stuff, this book is not for you. It is, after all, a book about how people died with weird magic and evil parts! Otherwise, it's a fantastic book with good characters and a great plot.",[396],[353],On the Day I Died: Stories from the Grave,"['""On the Day I Died - Stories from the Grave']",1384,1384.0,

Her mom keeps pushing her to keep going and eventually Celeste wants to keep going with the fashion show. Celeste gets bullied at school by a girl named Lively who has problems of her own. Read the book to find out more. I didn’t know what to expect when I started this book but by the end I thought it was a great book. 

I thought this book had several interesting themes. One theme for this book is, no matter what type of body you have you can complete great things. Another theme is, you don’t truly know who your friends are until you face adversity. 

I recommend this book for middle school girls, but not so much for boys. This is because the characters are all girls and the issues are more about girls. I also think that this book is not for boys because they tend to not deal with social drama in their friendships. Girls may also not like the book because it is based on someone that is larger. But I think that it was an awesome book because it deals with real world problems. 

So, this book was really good and I think that any middle school girl could enjoy it as much as I did, even if you don’t have a lot of drama in your life.",[35],[1],Models Don't Eat Chocolate Cookies,"[""Models Don't Eat Chocolate Cookies""]",2005,,

Both the tiger and  Sistine  are ferocious, and poor Rob scarcely knows how to act around either one. 
          The novel has much to teach its readers. First, I learned that some people name their children after very  famous churches. Who knew?! The Sistine Chapel is in  Italy and that's what Sistine was named for. I also liked the character Lilly Mae, and I learned from her that when people don't find a way to express their pain and sadness, they can make themselves sick and miserable. A final piece of knowledge that I gleaned is that some people are just super idiotic.
